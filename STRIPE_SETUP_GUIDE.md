# Stripe Checkout Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you complete the Stripe integration for the advanced website report purchase.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Stripe Account**: Make sure you have a Stripe account with your product already set up
2. **PHP Environment**: Your server should support PHP with cURL enabled
3. **No Composer Required**: This integration uses cURL directly, so no Composer or SDK installation is needed

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### 1. No Installation Required

This integration uses cURL to communicate with Stripe's API directly, so no SDK installation is needed. This makes it compatible with most shared hosting environments.

### 2. Configure Your Stripe Keys

Edit the `stripe-config.php` file and replace the placeholder values:

```php
// Replace these with your actual Stripe keys
define('STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY', 'pk_test_your_actual_key_here');
define('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', 'sk_test_your_actual_key_here');
define('STRIPE_PRICE_ID', 'price_your_actual_price_id_here');
```

### 3. Update the JavaScript

In `index-WIP-7.html`, update the Stripe initialization with your publishable key:

```javascript
const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_your_actual_publishable_key_here');
```

### 4. Update URLs for Production

When deploying to production, update the URLs in `stripe-config.php`:

```php
define('SUCCESS_URL', 'https://yourdomain.com/payment-success.php?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}');
define('CANCEL_URL', 'https://yourdomain.com/index-WIP-7.html');
```

## 📁 Files Created

1. **create-checkout-session.php** - Handles Stripe Checkout session creation
2. **payment-success.php** - Success page after payment
3. **view-report.php** - Displays the advanced report after purchase
4. **stripe-config.php** - Configuration file for Stripe keys
5. **composer.json** - Composer configuration for dependencies

## 🔄 Payment Flow

1. User clicks "Secure Payment" button
2. JavaScript calls `create-checkout-session.php`
3. PHP creates Stripe Checkout session
4. User is redirected to Stripe Checkout
5. After payment, user is redirected to `payment-success.php`
6. User can view their report at `view-report.php`

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- Never expose your secret key in client-side code
- Validate payments server-side before showing the report
- Consider implementing webhook verification for production
- Store purchase records in your database

## 🧪 Testing

Use Stripe's test card numbers:
- **Successful payment**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Declined payment**: 4000 0000 0000 0002

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Install the Stripe PHP SDK
2. Replace placeholder keys with your actual Stripe keys
3. Test the payment flow
4. Set up webhooks for production (optional but recommended)
5. Integrate with your actual AI report data

## 💡 Integration with AI Report

Currently, `view-report.php` uses mock data. To integrate with your actual AI report:

1. Modify the report retrieval logic in `view-report.php`
2. Connect to your database or API that stores the report data
3. Use the `website_url` from the Stripe metadata to fetch the correct report
