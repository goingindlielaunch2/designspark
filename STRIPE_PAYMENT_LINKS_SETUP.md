# Stripe Payment Links Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ **Quick Setup Instructions**

I've added **test Stripe Payment Links** to your pricing section. Here's how to replace them with your real payment links:

### **Step 1: Create Products in Stripe Dashboard**

1. **Log into your Stripe Dashboard** â†’ Products
2. **Create 3 products:**

   **Product 1: Quick Fix**
   - Name: `Quick Fix`
   - Price: `$99` (one-time)
   - Description: `Fix 1 specific issue with 48-hour turnaround and 30-day guarantee`

   **Product 2: Monthly Club** 
   - Name: `Monthly Club`
   - Price: `$1999` (monthly recurring)
   - Description: `Ongoing website support with unlimited requests and average 48-hour delivery`

   **Product 3: Website Overhaul**
   - Name: `Website Overhaul` 
   - Price: `$3999` (one-time)
   - Description: `Complete redesign and optimization of your existing website`

### **Step 2: Create Payment Links**

For each product:
1. **Click "Create payment link"**
2. **Configure settings:**
   - âœ… **Collect customer information**: Name + Email
   - âœ… **Success URL**: `https://yoursite.com/payment-success.php?package={PRODUCT_NAME}`
   - âœ… **Cancel URL**: `https://yoursite.com/index-WIP-7.php#pricing`
   - âœ… **Allow promotional codes**: Yes
   - âœ… **Payment methods**: Card + Apple Pay + Google Pay

3. **Copy the payment link URL** (looks like `https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxxx`)

### **Step 3: Replace Test Links in Your Code**

In `index-WIP-7.php`, replace these **test links** with your **real payment links**:

```php
// CURRENT TEST LINKS (replace these):

<!-- Quick Fix Button -->
<a href="https://buy.stripe.com/test_28o4hF2Ej4Xx0YE000">
<!-- Replace with your Quick Fix payment link -->

<!-- Monthly Club Button -->  
<a href="https://buy.stripe.com/test_14k4hF5X3dw52ga001">
<!-- Replace with your Monthly Club payment link -->

<!-- Website Overhaul Button -->
<a href="https://buy.stripe.com/test_6oE6pNgCXa1X8EM002">
<!-- Replace with your Website Overhaul payment link -->
```

### **Step 4: Update Payment Success Page**

Your `payment-success.php` can detect which package was purchased:

```php
<?php
$package = $_GET['package'] ?? 'service';
$packageNames = [
    'quick-fix' => 'Quick Fix',
    'monthly-club' => 'Monthly Club',
    'website-overhaul' => 'Website Overhaul'
];
$packageName = $packageNames[$package] ?? 'Website Service';
?>

<h1>ðŸŽ‰ Payment Successful!</h1>
<p>Thank you for purchasing our <strong><?php echo $packageName; ?></strong>!</p>
```
