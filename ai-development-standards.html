AI WEB DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS - PROJECT CONFIGURATION
1. AI AGENT SYSTEM PROMPT
Copy and paste this into your AI coding agent (Cursor, Claude, etc.) at the start of every session:

"You are a Senior Frontend Engineer. You must follow these strict rules:

TECH STACK: Use only Vanilla HTML5, Vanilla CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

NO FRAMEWORKS: Do not use Tailwind, Bootstrap, or any CSS-in-JS libraries.

CSS STYLE: Use CSS Custom Properties (variables). No pre-processors like SASS.

ARCHITECTURE: Keep HTML, CSS, and JS in separate files.

ACCESSIBILITY: Code must meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards by default.

QUALITY: Use semantic HTML5 tags and modern CSS (Grid/Flexbox/Container Queries)."

2. CSS & STYLING STANDARDS
Naming & Variables

Use kebab-case for all class names and variable names (e.g., --primary-color).

Define all design tokens in a :root block within a variables.css file.

Required variables: colors, spacing scale (rem-based), typography sizes, and border-radii.

CSS Best Practices

Layout: Use CSS Grid for page layouts and Flexbox for UI components.

Modern CSS: Use :has(), :is(), and native CSS nesting.

No ID Selectors: Use classes for styling to keep specificity low.

Responsive Design: Use clamp() for fluid typography and Container Queries (@container) for components.

3. HTML & ACCESSIBILITY (A11Y)
Structure

Always use semantic tags: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>.

                            Maintain a logical heading hierarchy (H1 -> H2 -> H3).

                            Accessibility Checklist

                            Interactive targets must be at least 44x44px.

                            Use :focus-visible to provide high-contrast focus indicators.

                            All <img> tags must have alt text (empty alt="" only for decorative images).

                            Forms: Every <input> must have a corresponding <label> using the 'for' attribute.

                                Color Contrast: Text must maintain a minimum 4.5:1 ratio against the background.

                                4. SEO & PERFORMANCE
                                Technical SEO

                                Use a single H1 per page.

                                Include descriptive Meta Titles (under 60 chars) and Descriptions (under 160 chars).

                                Implement JSON-LD Schema markup for the specific project type (e.g., SoftwareApplication
                                or HealthTopic).

                                Use
                                <link rel="canonical"> to prevent duplicate content issues.

                                Performance

                                Lazy-load images using loading="lazy".

                                Minimize the use of heavy external fonts; prefer system fonts or variable fonts.

                                Ensure all interactive elements are responsive within 100ms.

                                5. FRAMEWORK TRANSITION (RESERVED FOR REACT)
                                [FRAMEWORK_PLACEHOLDER]

                                When migrating to React:

                                Maintain Vanilla CSS via CSS Modules (.module.css).

                                Use Functional Components and Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.).

                                Keep business logic in custom hooks to separate it from UI components.

                                6. PROJECT DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
